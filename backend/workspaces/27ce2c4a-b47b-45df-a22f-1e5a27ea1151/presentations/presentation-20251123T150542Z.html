<h2>Business Requirements</h2>
<p>This document outlines the critical business requirements for Tranglo Malaysia&#39;s Data Modernization Proof of Concept (PoC). The primary objective of this PoC is to demonstrate the feasibility and value of migrating and transforming key data assets onto a scalable, efficient, and robust data warehouse solution within Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The current data infrastructure faces significant challenges in handling increasing data volumes, ensuring data freshness, and providing timely insights, particularly concerning the management of dimension and transaction tables.</p>
<p>Tranglo Malaysia currently grapples with data management inefficiencies that impede agile decision-making and operational effectiveness. A key challenge lies in the handling of dimension tables, which currently necessitate full daily reloads. This approach is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and increases the risk of data inconsistencies or delays in data availability. As data volumes grow, this full-load strategy becomes unsustainable, impacting the performance of downstream analytics and reporting. Concurrently, the management of transaction tables presents its own set of complexities. The existing methods for ingesting transactional data often lack the efficiency and real-time capabilities required for modern financial services, leading to delays in financial reporting, fraud detection, and customer insights. The absence of a robust Change Data Capture (CDC) append mode for these high-volume tables means that updates and new records are not integrated efficiently, creating a gap between operational systems and analytical platforms.</p>
<p>The proposed PoC aims to directly address these challenges by establishing a modernized data platform on GCP. This initiative will specifically focus on demonstrating a highly scalable and efficient data warehouse architecture capable of managing diverse data types with varying ingestion patterns. For dimension tables, the PoC will showcase an optimized approach that moves beyond full daily reloads, exploring strategies for incremental updates or Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) where applicable, leveraging GCP services to manage these updates effectively and ensure data accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. For transaction tables, the PoC will implement a robust CDC append mode, utilizing GCP’s streaming and batch processing capabilities to ingest and integrate transactional data efficiently and near real-time into the data warehouse, ensuring data freshness and supporting immediate analytical needs.</p>
<p>Key business requirements for this PoC include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The new data platform must seamlessly scale to accommodate Tranglo Malaysia&#39;s growing data volumes, projected to reach several terabytes, without compromising performance or increasing operational overhead. This is crucial for both historical data retention and future growth.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency in Data Ingestion</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Dimension Tables</strong>: Demonstrate an efficient mechanism for handling dimension table updates that significantly reduces the processing time and resource consumption compared to current full daily loads. This includes validating strategies for incremental updates while maintaining historical context.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Tables</strong>: Establish a reliable and performant CDC append mode for high-volume transaction tables, ensuring that new and changed data records are captured and ingested into the data warehouse with minimal latency, supporting near real-time analytics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Freshness</strong>: Ensure that analytical data, especially from transaction tables, is sufficiently fresh to support timely business decisions and operational monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Data Accuracy &amp; Consistency</strong>: The data ingested and transformed within the GCP data warehouse must maintain high levels of accuracy and consistency, providing a single source of truth for business intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>Performance for Analytics</strong>: The data warehouse must provide high-performance query capabilities to support various analytical workloads, including complex reporting, ad-hoc analysis, and potential machine learning initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Optimization</strong>: The solution architecture should be designed with cost-efficiency in mind, leveraging GCP’s serverless and managed services to optimize infrastructure and operational expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>This one-month PoC will specifically demonstrate the implementation of these capabilities using Google Cloud products such as BigQuery for the core data warehouse, Dataform for data transformation and orchestration, Cloud Storage for landing and staging data, and Pub/Sub for messaging to facilitate CDC pipelines. The PoC will focus on a selected subset of dimension and transaction tables to prove the concept of efficient ingestion, transformation, and storage, thereby validating the architectural approach for a full-scale data modernization effort. Upon successful completion, Tranglo Malaysia will have a clear blueprint and validated architecture for a data platform that supports its strategic business objectives for enhanced data-driven decision-making.</p>

<h2>High-Level Architecture for Data Modernization PoC</h2>
<p>The proposed architecture outlines a robust, scalable, and secure data modernization platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Tranglo Malaysia. This high-level design focuses on ingesting diverse data types from on-premise SQL Server databases, transforming them, and making them available for advanced analytics and business intelligence. The architecture is built with a strong emphasis on automation, governance, and future scalability, leveraging key GCP services to ensure an efficient and reliable data pipeline.</p>
<h3>Data Ingestion Layer</h3>
<p>The initial phase involves establishing secure and efficient data ingestion from on-premise SQL Server. For <strong>dimension tables</strong>, which typically undergo daily full loads, a batch-oriented approach will be employed. Data will be extracted from the SQL Server, potentially using existing ETL tools or custom scripts, and landed securely into <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>. From Cloud Storage, <strong>Dataflow</strong> (or <strong>Data Fusion</strong> for a more visual, managed ETL experience) will be utilized to process these batch loads, performing initial cleansing and schema enforcement before ingesting them into a raw layer within <strong>BigQuery</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>transaction tables</strong>, which require near real-time updates and are sensitive to data freshness, a Change Data Capture (CDC) strategy will be implemented. An on-premise CDC mechanism (e.g., Debezium, a commercial CDC solution, or SQL Server’s native CDC capabilities) will capture data changes (inserts, updates, deletes). These events will be published to <strong>Pub/Sub</strong>, acting as a highly scalable message queuing service. A streaming <strong>Dataflow</strong> pipeline will subscribe to these Pub/Sub topics, process the incoming events in an append-only mode, and land them into a raw transaction table in <strong>BigQuery</strong>. This ensures that transactional data is available for analysis with minimal latency, supporting operational reporting and timely insights. Cloud Storage will also serve as a durable landing zone for raw CDC streams before processing by Dataflow, offering cost-effective storage and disaster recovery capabilities.</p>
<h3>Data Processing and Storage Layer</h3>
<p>Once raw data resides in BigQuery and Cloud Storage, the next step involves transformation and curation. <strong>BigQuery</strong> serves as the central analytical data warehouse, designed for petabyte-scale data analysis with unparalleled speed and efficiency. Raw data, whether from batch or streaming ingestion, will first land in dedicated raw datasets within BigQuery.</p>
<p>Data transformation pipelines will be orchestrated using <strong>Cloud Composer</strong> (managed Apache Airflow) to define, schedule, and monitor complex workflows. These workflows will trigger <strong>Dataform</strong> jobs, allowing for SQL-based data transformation directly within BigQuery. Dataform promotes software engineering best practices for data teams, enabling version control, testing, and documentation of data transformations. This ensures data quality, consistency, and traceability as data is refined from raw to curated layers within BigQuery. Datasets will be structured into raw, staging, and curated layers, with the curated layer optimized for business intelligence and advanced analytics. For extremely large-scale, complex transformations or machine learning feature engineering that might require custom code execution beyond SQL, <strong>Dataproc</strong> clusters can be spun up on demand to process data stored in Cloud Storage or BigQuery.</p>
<h3>Analytics and Visualization Layer</h3>
<p>The curated data in BigQuery becomes the single source of truth for analytics. <strong>BigQuery ML (BQML)</strong> will be leveraged to build and deploy machine learning models directly within BigQuery using standard SQL queries, enabling predictive analytics without moving data to separate ML platforms. This simplifies the ML workflow and accelerates time-to-insight for use cases like fraud detection, customer churn prediction, or demand forecasting.</p>
<p>For business intelligence and data visualization, <strong>Looker</strong> will connect directly to BigQuery. Looker provides a modern, intuitive platform for exploring data, creating interactive dashboards, and delivering actionable insights to business users. Its semantic modeling layer (LookML) ensures consistent metrics and definitions across the organization, fostering data literacy and self-service analytics.</p>
