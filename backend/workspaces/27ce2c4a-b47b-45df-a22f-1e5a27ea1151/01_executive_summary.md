# Executive Summary: Data Modernization Proof of Concept for Tranglo Malaysia

This Executive Summary outlines a critical Proof of Concept (PoC) for Tranglo Malaysia, focused on modernizing its data infrastructure by migrating from an on-premise SQL Server environment to a robust, scalable, and intelligent Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ecosystem. This strategic initiative is designed to be completed within a focused one-month timeframe, demonstrating the tangible benefits and feasibility of a full-scale data transformation.

Tranglo Malaysia currently faces significant data management challenges that impede agile analytics and real-time decision-making. Specifically, the PoC will address two key technical hurdles: the efficient ingestion and processing of dimension tables that lack explicit timestamps, necessitating daily full loads for accurate data reflection, and the seamless integration of high-volume transaction tables utilizing a Change Data Capture (CDC) append mode. These challenges are representative of the complexities involved in transitioning legacy data systems to a modern cloud paradigm.

The successful execution of this PoC is paramount for Tranglo Malaysia's long-term strategic objectives. By leveraging GCP's advanced data capabilities, including BigQuery for scalable warehousing, Dataform for data transformation, Dataproc for big data processing, and Pub/Sub for real-time data ingestion, this modernization effort will unlock enhanced data accessibility, improve data quality, and significantly reduce operational overheads. It will enable Tranglo to move beyond traditional batch processing limitations, fostering a data-driven culture that can react swiftly to market changes, optimize operational efficiency, and drive informed business growth. This PoC will not only validate the technical architecture and processes but also lay the foundational groundwork for a future-proof data platform that supports advanced analytics, machine learning initiatives, and greater business intelligence, positioning Tranglo Malaysia at the forefront of financial technology innovation.
