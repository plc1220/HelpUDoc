# Research: Custom Agent UI and Backend

## UI Component Library

### Decision
We will use **Material-UI (MUI)** for the UI component library.

### Rationale
- **Comprehensive Component Library**: MUI offers a wide range of pre-built components that will accelerate the development of the UI.
- **Good Documentation and Community Support**: MUI has excellent documentation and a large community, which will be valuable for troubleshooting and learning.
- **Theming and Customization**: MUI's theming capabilities will allow us to create a custom look and feel that matches the provided UI mockup.
- **React Compatibility**: MUI is designed specifically for React, ensuring seamless integration with our chosen frontend framework.

### Alternatives Considered
- **Ant Design**: A popular and feature-rich component library, but MUI's aesthetic is a closer match to the provided mockup.
- **Chakra UI**: A highly customizable and accessible component library, but MUI's larger component set is better suited for this project.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a great deal of flexibility, but would require more time to build custom components from scratch.
